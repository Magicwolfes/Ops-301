# Diversity & Inclusion


## When Women Stopped Coding

### What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative. It became the story we told ourselves about the computing revolution. It helped define who geeks were, and it created techie culture. These computers were marketed almost entirely to men and boys.

## Why Diversity matters to your tech company

### When are diversity efforts most successful?
Diversity efforts are more likely to be successful when leaders in an organization demonstrate a clear commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and provide the necessary resources to support these efforts.It is also important to recognize that achieving diversity and inclusion is an ongoing process, and success may look different for each organization depending on their unique culture and goals.

### Why do diverse companies perform better?
A diverse workforce brings a variety of perspectives and ideas: Having employees with different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives can lead to more creative problem-solving and innovative ideas

### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
For example, a technology company that produces a health app may have a diverse user base with different needs, preferences, and experiences related to health and wellness. By conducting user research and gathering feedback from a diverse group of users, the company can gain insights into the unique challenges and opportunities that different users face when using the app
