# What's the difference between windows and window server

## What is a server, and how is it different from a regular computer? How would you describe this difference to a friend who doesn’t know much about computers?
A server is a computer program or device that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called clients. The main difference between a server and a regular computer is that a server is designed to handle a large volume of requests from multiple clients simultaneously

The server is like a waiter who takes orders and serves food to multiple tables at once, while a regular computer is like a single diner who orders and eats their own meal
## How does the way Windows Server receives updates differ from Windows Home and Pro?
> Windows Server doesn’t support signing in with a Microsoft account, so you can’t bring your settings to it from another PC. Instead, you’ll need to either sign in with a local account or a domain account. While Windows 10 Home is finally getting a pause updates feature, Windows Server can disable updates entirely through group policy 

## Does Windows Server have different hardware requirements than Windows Home or Pro?
Windows Server is designed to run on servers that are used for business purposes and are expected to handle a much higher workload, it requires more powerful hardware than a typical home or personal computer.
