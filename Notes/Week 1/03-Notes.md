## What is CIDR notation? a CIDR block?
CIDR notation is a way of representing a CIDR block, which is simply a range of IP addresses.


## How many octets are found in an IPv4 address?
An IPv4 (version 4 of IP) address is usually represented as four 8-bit decimal numbers or octets separated by dots, for example 127.0.0.1


## Setting binary aside and using the decimal system, what is the range of numbers found in an octet?
0-32 (0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255)

## What does the final digit after the “/” represent in an IPv4 address?
The final digit after the “/” represents how many bits make up the mask.

## How many IP addresses are in the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24?
256 Ip addresses


# What is a network segmentation and why it matters?

## In your own words, describe network segmentation.
Network segmentation is a way of dividing a network into multiple segements or subnets. This makes it easiser for admins to control the network traffic
> Limiting access privileges to those who truly need it
Protecting the network from widespread cyberattacks
Boosting network performance by reducing the number of users in specific zones


## Network segmentation isn’t important as long as the network is using a well configured firewall. Do you agree? Why or why not?
I disagree. It's like powering a house. If you put all the circuits on one breaker, a small short will shut the entire house off. It's important to minimize damage between networks


## What is a screened subnet?
This includes the subnetworks that expose externally facing systems – where the handshakes take place on your network.

## Cameras, ID card scanners, locked doors and biometrics are just a few examples of what type of security?
Traditional Physical Security - This is not to be taken lightly, as the risk of a physical breach can be more harmful than a digital one.
